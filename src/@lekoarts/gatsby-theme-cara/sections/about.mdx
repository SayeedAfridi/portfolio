# About Me

##### I like to call myself a Nerd

I am a Computer Science student. I am doing B.Sc in CSE in a well known university [Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University](http://hstu.ac.bd) in Bangladesh.

I like to develop web apps. It's soooo much fun and a hobby of mine.

I also take part in various competative programming contests and solves some problems with c++. All the solves are in my [SolvedProblem](https://github.com/SayeedAfridi/SolvedProblem.git) github repo.

I spend prety much time with computer to become a good developer.

Wish luck for me.

Thank You.
